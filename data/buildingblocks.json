It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the users program to any unreliability of the underlying network protocol. There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram.",
