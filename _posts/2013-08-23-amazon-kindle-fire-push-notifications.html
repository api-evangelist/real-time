<p>Pushwoosh is a free multi-platform push notification service, which enables developers, marketing reps and product owners to keep in touch with their app users, drive engagement, promote products, push up sales, and track the progress of the campaign with notifications.Providing almost instant access to the service, we take the load off developers who can focus on creating beautiful products, deploy them on multiple platforms and support push notifications to all these platforms at the same time.Our company is now using Unity 3D for a couple of major games in development and it became clear we wanted to benefit from this amazing work done by Pushwoosh team.It requires minimum efforts on our side and delivers functionality which is essential for most of the gaming projects.Olga Zobova
