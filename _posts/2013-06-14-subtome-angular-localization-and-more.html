<p>The SubToMe button we launched a couple weeks is now getting a significant traction and has been added to thousands of blogs and sites!This makes us very proud!Many readers now also support direct registration which makes them extremely convenient to use when susbcribing on the fly!AngularJS
  SubToMe is the perfect single page application as it does not even have an application server.Itâ€™s just static files (HTML + JS) linked together with smart redirects and a little localstorage love.</p>
