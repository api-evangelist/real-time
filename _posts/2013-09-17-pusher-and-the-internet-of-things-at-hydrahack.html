<p>The Internet of Things is an initiative to take the Internet we know and love and turn it into something more than just documents.The Internet is becoming embedded into all kinds of devices and with the proliferation of low cost devices like the Raspberry Pi , the Arduino  and the Tessel , it’s becoming easier than ever to build interesting hacks linked to the Internet that allow you to do cool stuff marrying both software and hardware together.We at Pusher are, of course, very excited about this as it’s a great use case for our platform!Our community has contributed a number of great Client Libraries  for just about any language, which you can use to send messages between devices in real time.I’ll be talking about how you can use our service to harness the power of real-time in your IoT project.</p>
