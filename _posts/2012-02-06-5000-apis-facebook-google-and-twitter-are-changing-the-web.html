<p>Our API directory has hit another major milestone.We now list 5,000 APIs, just a short four months since passing 4,000.No longer is the web simply about links connecting one site to another.Instead, developers are using tools to connect data and functionality from one site to another site.Itâ€™s an incredible transformation that has happened over a very short period of time.</p>
