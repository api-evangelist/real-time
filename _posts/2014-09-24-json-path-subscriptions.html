<p>A bunch of our customers use Superfeedr to poll JSON APIs.Rather than wasting their resources, they use us to subscribe to JSON documents using webhooks.When the document eventually updates, we push them the whole document.Yet, most of the time, they’re not interested in the whole document, just parts of it, and up until today, there was no way to subscribe to parts of it.Let’s assume my awesome application displays user profiles from Github.</p>
