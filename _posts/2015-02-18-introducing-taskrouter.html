<p>Today we announced the launch of TaskRouter.TaskRouter is the beating heart of a contact center, made available in the cloud as an API for developers looking to solve any kind of intelligent routing challenge.TaskRouter can dynamically assign tasks of any type to the workers that can best handle them.Calls, SMS, support tickets, leads or even machine data can be routed based on the “skills” required and the priority set.We built TaskRouter after seeing a common thread in the challenges our customers faced in building great customer experiences.</p>
