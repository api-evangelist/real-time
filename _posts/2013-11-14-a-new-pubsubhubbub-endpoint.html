<p>We’ve been a bit silent in the past couple months here at Superfeedr.It’s because we’ve been working on a complete rewrite of our PubSubHubbub endpoint.Before Up until now, our PubSubHubbub endpoint was part of our main frontend Rails app.4 years ago, Rails was still the most advanced framework to build web applications.This frontend would then interract directly with the database (adding feeds, subscriptions) and put messages in a queue (pings) for the backend to process.</p>
