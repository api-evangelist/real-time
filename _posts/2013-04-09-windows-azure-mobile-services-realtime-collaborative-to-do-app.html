<p>Inspired by the first two talks at #stacked13 by Mike Taulty and then Maarten Balliauw I thought I’d get jump straight into Windows Azure Mobile Services and build an a realtime collaborative synchronised todo list.I’d do this based on the Get started with data in Mobile Services HTML guide.I would then and host it on a Windows Azure web site.Note: I want to publish this quite quickly so that people at the event can have a play.So, the rest of this post will be a bit of a brain dump and I’ll tidy it up later
  In Mike’s talk he mentioned that the mobile service JavaScript library has just been released.</p>
