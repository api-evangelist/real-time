<p>If your app needs to keep up with changes in Drive, whether to sync files, initiate workflows, or just keep users up to date with the latest info, you’re likely familiar with Drive’s changes feed.But periodic polling for changes has always required a delicate balance between resources and timeliness.Now there’s a better way.With push notifications for the Drive API, periodic polling is no longer necessary.Your app can subscribe for changes to a user’s drive and get notified whenever changes occur.</p>
