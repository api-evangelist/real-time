{% include JB/setup %}<p>Currently just a “proof of concept” from Mozilla Labs, TowTruck is a service which adds real-time collaboration to any website.Similar to what you’d find in Google Drive, the awkwardly named TowTruck works with just a snippet of JavaScript code, and allows for real-time authoring, messaging and voice chatting via Web RTC.Mozilla’s goal with this project is to make it easier for everyone to work together on the Web — given how important remote communication has become, it’s great to see Mozilla developing an open-source solution.And because it’s open source, don’t be surprised to see customized TowTruck-powered features and services pop up.You can view a demo of the service in action below:

 Mozilla warns that TowTruck is “alpha-quality software,” and in our own tests, we found the service to be clunky, yet promising.</p>
