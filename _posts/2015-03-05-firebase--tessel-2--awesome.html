<p>Since the original Tessel came out over a year ago, there have been a lot of people interested in combining Firebase and Tessel to easily develop on IoT devices.As those posts show, there was no solid solution for quickly prototyping Internet enabled Things with Tessel and Firebase.With the announcement of the Tessel 2 yesterday, weâ€™re happy to say that Firebase + Tessel 2 now works out of the box, and enables you to quickly build and scale production ready IoT devices and infrastructure.Check out the following video demonstrating streaming accelerometer measurements from the Tessel 2 to Firebase and back in realtime.Stay tuned for more IoT related blog posts, like how you can use our new private backups feature to move data from Firebase to BigQuery for advanced analytics.</p>
