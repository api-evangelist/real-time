<p>After more than a decade in the works, HTTP, one of the most important specifications of the Internet, got a new version, HTTP/2.The new version brings several benefits to make the Web faster, including cheaper requests via multiplexing messages on a connection at the same time, header compression, and reducing server and network load.Mark Nottingham, chairman of the IETF HTTP Working Group, has written Nine Things to Expect from HTTP/2, which gives a good, detailed explanation of what the new standard brings to the table for both client and server Web technologies.The browser vendors have been quick off the blocks in their support for HTTP/2.Chrome and Firefox already support HTTP/2, and other browser vendors should follow suit.</p>
