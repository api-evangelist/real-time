<p>Paul Ramsey is a Solutions Architect at CartoDB, helping customers build beautiful maps and apps on the CartoDB platform.Firebase is an awesome platform for making realtime applications, allowing developers to push and receive updates from multiple clients easily.A common use case for realtime data  is storing objects in motion and analyzing those data points as they move and generate streams of notifications.Handling the volume of data that moving objects create, and slicing and dicing the data to find interesting analytical results is the kind of task for which SQL is a great fit.One line of SQL is sufficient to answer almost any analytical question.</p>
