<p>Pushwoosh is a free multi-platform push notification service, which enables developers, marketing reps and product owners to keep in touch with their app users, drive engagement, promote products, push up sales, and track the progress of the campaign with notifications.Providing almost instant access to the service, we take the load off developers who can focus on creating beautiful products, deploy them on multiple platforms and support push notifications to all these platforms at the same time.Pushwoosh greatly reduced our time-to-market for our notification services.Operating in a highly competitive market this keeps us at the front-end of innovation, a requirement for any modern company these days.I specifically appreciate the quick and accurate support; it is a great pleasure to work with them.</p>
