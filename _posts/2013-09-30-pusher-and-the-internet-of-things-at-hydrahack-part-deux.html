<p>It’s been a busy week at Pusher!I’ve been on the road this week, and it’s always great to go out there and meet the people who make our products great – the makers that use our API to create brilliant real-time experiences – as well as those that may not have used our product before.I’ve had the opportunity to meet both types of people this week that I wanted to share with you all.Last week, I visited HydraHack in Birmingham.For those who missed my blogpost last week about it, HydraHack is an event put on by 383 Project’s Leon Barrett in Vertu Bar, situated in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter.</p>
