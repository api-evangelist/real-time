<p>Thereâ€™s no shortage of integration platforms in the cloud these days with Tibco Software becoming the latest vendor to join their ranks.Tibco this week unfurled Tibco Cloud Bus, a subscription based integration service that differs from other services in that IT organizations have the option of deploying it anywhere they like versus being locked into a particular cloud computing platform.According to Steve Leung, director of product marketing for Tibco, while there has been a definite shift towards the cloud, IT organizations still want the flexibility to be able to move the focal point of their integration efforts from one cloud provider to another, or even back to their own data centers.Leung says Tibco Cloud Bus supports TIBCO Cloud Bus makes use of connectors to deliver real-time integration across a wide variety of applications.Changes are reflected in all connected cloud applications as they happen, without waiting for the next batch update, says Leung.</p>
