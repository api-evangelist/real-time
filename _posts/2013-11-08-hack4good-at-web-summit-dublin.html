<p>Last week, I was lucky enough to escape the adverse (i.e.slightly windy) conditions in London and fly to Dublin for Web Summit 2013.It’s the first time I’ve ever been to Ireland so I was curious to see what kind of conference Web Summit would be, given the fact that – and I think the Irish hackers out there would agree with me – there are rarely web events of this kind of scale in Ireland.After 3 days and 574 miles travelled, however, I was not disappointed.</p>
