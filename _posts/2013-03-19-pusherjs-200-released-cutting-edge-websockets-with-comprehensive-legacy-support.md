<p>We’re very excited to announce the release of a massive new update to our Javascript client library.The new release adds a smarter connection strategy with additional fallback mechanisms such as HTTP-based transport.These changes further improve our support for legacy devices and network complications such as corporate firewalls.The Javascript client library is our most widely used library.Its aim is to quickly and reliably connect browser based clients to Pusher.</p>
