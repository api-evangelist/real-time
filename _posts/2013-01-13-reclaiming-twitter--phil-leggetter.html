<p>For a long while now I’ve not been getting as much out of Twitter as I used to.There’s too much information to take in.I’ve long said that Twitter is throw-away.If you miss something then it doesn’t matter.If it’s important then I’ll see a retweet or pick up the information from somewhere else.</p>
