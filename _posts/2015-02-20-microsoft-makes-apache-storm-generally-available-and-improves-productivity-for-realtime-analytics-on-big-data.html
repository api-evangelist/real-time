<p>On Wednesday at the Strata+Hadop World conference, we announced Apache Storm becoming generally available.This post will give you the ins and outs of this new offering.Apache Storm is a distributed, fault-tolerant, open source real-time event processing solution.Storm was originally used by Twitter to process massive streams of data from the Twitter firehose.Storm is ideal for real-time scenarios like fraud detection, click stream analysis, financial alerts, telemetry from connected sensors and devices (IoT), social analytics, ‘always on’ ETL pipelines, and network monitoring.</p>
