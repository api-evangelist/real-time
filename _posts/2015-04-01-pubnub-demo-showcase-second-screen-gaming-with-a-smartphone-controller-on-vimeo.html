<p>Demo it here: pubnub.com/developers/demos/pongnub/ 
PongNub is a second-screen game with a smartphone controller.The controller uses JavaScript and JQuery in a mobile browser, and the game interface uses JavaScript in a browser.Users can control their paddle in realtime using the control, with Pub/Sub Messaging (pubnub.com/how-it-works/data-streams/) taking care of streaming the signals.</p>
