<p>For most organizations, building a modern-day cloud application that rivals something as clean and fast as Uber or Facebook is, obviously, not an easy-to-do task.The art of crafting a responsive app that’s able to load up and transmit data in real time demands a developer team that’s skilled in multiple web frameworks and languages like Angular.js, Node.js and PHP.Meteor Development Group wants to simplify this process, and it thinks the best way to do so is to build everything in JavaScript, the ubiquitous programming language that’s the backbone of web browsers.</p>
