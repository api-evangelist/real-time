<p>In my quest to change the world, I’ve been experimenting with an HTML5 game engine to push the limits of the browser as a platform for serious gaming. melonJS has been my tool of choice because it’s lightweight, runs well on mobile, and is very easy to use.Starting last year, I became co-developer on the project.One question that always comes up on the melonJS forum is the best way to use Node.js/socket.</p>
