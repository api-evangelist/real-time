<p>Earlier this year we announced the open source Pushpin project, a server component that makes it easy to scale out realtime HTTP APIs.Just what kind of scale are we talking about though?To demonstrate, we put together some code that pushes a truckload of data through a cluster of Pushpin instances.Here’s the output of its dashboard after a successful run: 
Before getting into the details of how we did this, let’s first establish some goals: 
We want to scale an arbitrary realtime API.This API, from the perspective of a connecting client, shouldn’t need to be in any way specific to the components we are using to scale it.</p>
