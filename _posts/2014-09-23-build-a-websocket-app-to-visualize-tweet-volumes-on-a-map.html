<p>This tutorial shows how to use WebSocket, Twitter search, and the Google Maps API to create a Node.js web app that displays the provenance of tweets on a map in real time.Ill also show how to deploy the app to IBM® Bluemix™ (and in general to any Cloud Foundry based PaaS).I wrote the app because I wanted an at-a-glance view of the geographical origin of tweets that mention a particular topic.For example: Where throughout  the world are people tweeting about innovation?</p>
