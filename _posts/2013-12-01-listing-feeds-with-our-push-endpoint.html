<p>Releasing our new API endpoint last month has already enabled us to release the oldest feature request: subscribing and retrieving feeds in one single call.Today, we’re introducing another long time requested feature: the ability to list PubSubHubbub subscriptions.It’s considered good practice when using PubSubHubbub to use different callback urls for each susbcription performed.This way it’s much easier to debug, load balance (consistently!) or even handle notifications faster.</p>
