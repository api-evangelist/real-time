<p>Druid, an open source database designed for real-time analysis, is moving to the Apache 2 software license in order to hopefully spur more use of and innovation around the project. It was open sourced in late 2012 under the GPL license, which is generally considered more restrictive than the Apache license in terms of how software can be reused.Druid was created by advertising analytics startup Metamarkets (see disclosure) and is used by numerous large web companies, including eBay, Netflix, PayPal, Time Warner Cable and Yahoo.Because of the nature Metamarkets’ business, Druid requires data to include a timestamp and is probably best described as a time-series database.It’s designed to ingest terabytes of data per hour and is often used for things such as analyzing user or network activity over time.</p>
