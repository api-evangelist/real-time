<p>The ability for apps to work offline is the most requested feature we see from developers.Queuing up requests made offline works in the beginning, but it doesn’t scale.You quickly find that two collaborators end up overwriting each others’ data, and data integrity is lost.We believe this doesn’t need to be a limitation which inhibits the success of your app, which is why we’ve built Offline Sync.StackMob’s Offline Sync represents a smarter class of client-server synchronization.</p>
