<p>Weâ€™ve built a new feature for Firebase that is now ready for an expanded beta.Private backups is an advanced feature for customers on our Bonfire plan or above that backs up your Firebase data every night and uploads it to Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3 buckets.On a daily basis, we will back up your Firebase data and security rules and then upload them to a timestamped folder in your cloud bucket.This folder will contain a.json
 file with the Firebase data as well as a 
security_rules.</p>
