<p>Real-time collaboration is a powerful feature for getting work done inside Google docs.We extended that functionality with the Realtime API to enable you to create Google-docs style collaborative applications with minimal effort.Integration of the API becomes even easier with a new in memory mode, which allows you to manipulate a Realtime document using the standard API without being connected to our servers.No user login or authorization is required.This is great for building applications where Google login is optional, writing tests for your app, or experimenting with the API before configuring auth.</p>
