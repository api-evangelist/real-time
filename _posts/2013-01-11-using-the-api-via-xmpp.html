<p>As you may know, the Fanout.io cloud supports delivering data to both HTTP and XMPP clients/endpoints.What you may not know is that Fanoutâ€™s own API is accessible via both protocols, too.This means that not only can you publish messages or make configuration changes via REST, you can perform these same tasks by sending stanzas.Why would you want to do this?</p>
