<p>Last October Hacker News launched their official API and I’ve been trying to find an excuse to play with it ever since.The idea finally hit me last week: what if I built an application that notified me via SMS whenever someone posted a link to my domain on Hacker News?Hacker News is known to drive a ton of traffic and I probably want to be ready to spin up some extra servers if I end up making it on the front page.If you’ve also been waiting for an excuse to play with the Hacker News API you’re in luck because today I’m going to show you how to build this application using Node.js, Firebase and Twilio.</p>
