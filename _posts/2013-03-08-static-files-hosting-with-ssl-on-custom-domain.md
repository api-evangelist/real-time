{% include JB/setup %}<p>SubToMe is a universal subscribe button.One of its key design goals was to use only static files.There should be no server involved: it’s not an app, it’s a button.Another key aspects of the SubToMe button is that it’s included on many page, and needs to be able to run on any page (thanks to the bookmarklet), including https pages.With that in mind, we are forced to host the button on a system that supports SSL.</p>
