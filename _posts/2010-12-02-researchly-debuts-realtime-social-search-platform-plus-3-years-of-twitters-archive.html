<p>Theres a new tool that online marketers, brand managers and social media experts should be aware of: Research.ly, a new social search platform for researching Twitter conversations and tracking the associated analytics.But this is not your average Twitter analytics tool.Research.ly uses parent company PeopleBrowsrs proprietary server technology to surface a historical analysis of Tweets, going back three years, thanks to its access to Twitters full feed, a data stream often referred to as the Twitter firehose.</p>
