<p>Thanks to everyone who turned up for the inaugural “engineering at scale”  event we ran with Smarkets  and Future Ad Labs  last night.We enjoyed the opportunity to share some of the interesting technical challenges we regularly deal with, and hope it was enjoyable to attend.It was great to meet you all
  The format of the event was a bit of an experiment, and was driven by a desire to engage with the engineering community in London.There are tons of people working on really interesting and difficult challenges, and we want to create regular opportunities that allows us to swap stories.It’s very easy to become insular about the kind of technology you produce internally as a company, but it’s a benefit to everyone if we can share more.</p>
