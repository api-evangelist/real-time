<p>This week we’re releasing more tools to track OpenStreetMap metadata.Together with the American Red Cross, we’re launching OSM Metadata API, a tool to help enable analysis of OSM’s rich metadata at the user and comment level.By using hashtags in changeset comments such as #MissingMaps, API access can enable groups like the Red Cross to gain feedback from OSM deployments.We’re building off our osm-meta-util work we released several weeks ago to store and index OSM metadata.We built the API on Elasticsearch and Node.</p>
