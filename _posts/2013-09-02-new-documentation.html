<p>It was long overdue but we’re finally introducing a completely refactored documentation.Up until now, the documentation was part of our main site.This was a bad choice for several reasons:
  updating the docs means we’d have to deploy the whole frontend site
  taking pull requests was not easy/doable
  if the site was to go down for any reason, docs would be inaccessible
 
  We suck at making shinny things and docs should always be the clearest part of any website: Where would you read docs about docs?Understanding that, we immediately looked at Bootstrap.Aside from being one of the most important efforts to the open web success of the last 18 months (more on that later), it was designed with readers in mind: fonts, spacing, margins, paddings… etc, everything is optimal for the reader, and Bootstrap v3 just came out!</p>
