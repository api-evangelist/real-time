<p>Pushwoosh is a free multi-platform push notification service, which enables developers, marketing reps and product owners to keep in touch with their app users, drive engagement, promote products, push up sales, and track the progress of the campaign with notifications.Providing almost instant access to the service, we take the load off developers who can focus on creating beautiful products, deploy them on multiple platforms and support push notifications to all these platforms at the same time.Pushwoosh is just the solution we were looking for.What can I say, it does exactly what it says in the tin.It dropped straight into our game with no effort and now our game users send and receive notifications to and from each other.</p>
