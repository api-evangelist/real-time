<p>Well be at Startup Weekend Edinburgh this weekend and were really excited to be involved.Theres a lot of innovation in Edinburgh and Scotland in general (and I live there so really want to be involved) so we want to help startups by getting them up and running as quickly as possible.Its one of the amazing things about a hosted service - it takes you minutes instead of days to add really valuable functionality to applications.Startup weekends offer a fantastic opportunity to not only focus on innovation and new startup ideas but also give you access to a whole bunch of resources all in one place.As well as working with other attendees in the form of developers, designers, marketeers etc.</p>
