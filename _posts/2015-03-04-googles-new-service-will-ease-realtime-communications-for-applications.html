<p>Google has a new real-time messaging system available in beta for its cloud service called Google Cloud Pub/Sub, the company said on Wednesday in a blog post.The system in theory will enable applications and services to communicate with each other in real time, regardless if they are built atop the Google Cloud or run on-premises.In today’s world of distributed systems, its important for messages to flow between applications and services as fast as possible in order for applications to present the freshest information to users as well as the IT admins responsible for managing the infrastructure.This is why Apache Kafka is so popular with companies like Hortonworks, which added support for the real-time messaging framework last summer.The new messaging system targets developers looking to build complex, distributed applications on the Google Cloud and it follows in line with the recently announced Google Container Engine back in November.</p>
