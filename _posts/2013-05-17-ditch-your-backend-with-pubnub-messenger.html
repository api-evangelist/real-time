<p>Although ‘messaging’ has become increasingly popular among web applications, there have been issues with connectivity, a poor feature set, and compatibility with one platform.These are most likely due to the complexity of building a scalable backend that connects in real-time to multiple clients.I set out to fix this with PubNub Messenger.My task for this project was to create a well-featured and scalable chat application that runs on Android, iOS, and Desktop in a few weeks work.No big deal, right?</p>
