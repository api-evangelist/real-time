<p>Pushwoosh is just the solution we were looking for.What can I say, it does exactly what it says in the tin.It dropped straight into our game with no effort and now our game users send and receive notifications to and from each other.From HQ, we are also able send notifications to targeted users or groups of users.Our apologies for the inconvenience, but we are forced to reschedule the downtime previously planned on 12:00 (noon) 11th of June, 2014.</p>
