<p>Justin Karneges, CEO of Fanout, stood up in front of 50 developers at a recent API Craft meetup in San Francisco and painted a picture of a world where APIs pushed data to recipients in realtime. In Justin’s vision, news, stock information, chat, collaborative tools, and games will all be handled with a realtime API protocol called GRIP.After Justin sat down, Mark Jen, a software engineer at Square, addressed the crowd. Square is a local San Francisco company helping businesses to accept credit card payments. It’s rumored that they were valued at $6 billion last October.</p>
