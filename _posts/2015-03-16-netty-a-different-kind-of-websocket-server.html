<p>Netty is used today in all kinds of applications, all over the Internet, to handle thousands (if not millions) of chat conversations, multiplayer games including Minecraft, Twitter, and many other applications.However, it hasn’t made it very far into the mindshare of enterprise programmers developing business applications.I believe that Netty can introduce a new wave of functionality that other solutions simply cannot match because of its fully bi-directional text and binary non-HTTP data transport, along with its support for many more concurrent clients than traditional “thread-per-socket” servers.You may know about Netty’s prowess with WebSockets, but did you know it can function extremely well as a traditional web server?Due to its very thoughtful design, by adding appropriate handlers to its pipeline, Netty can handle virtually any traffic.</p>
