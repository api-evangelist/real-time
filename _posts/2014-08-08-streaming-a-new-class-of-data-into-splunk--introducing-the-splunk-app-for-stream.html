<p>Last year in December, we announced the acquisition of Cloudmeter – a company with technology that captures data directly from the network traffic – a rapidly growing source of big data.Today, I’m stoked to announce the general availability of the Splunk App for Stream v6.0, which stems from that acquisition.So, why is wire data  (data from the network) important?Wire data has the benefit of capturing all data in real-time – it is the communication vehicle for applications and systems to talk to each other, making it a very authoritative source of critical information.</p>
