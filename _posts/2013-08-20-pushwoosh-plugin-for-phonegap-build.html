<p>Pushwoosh is a free multi-platform push notification service, which enables developers, marketing reps and product owners to keep in touch with their app users, drive engagement, promote products, push up sales, and track the progress of the campaign with notifications.Providing almost instant access to the service, we take the load off developers who can focus on creating beautiful products, deploy them on multiple platforms and support push notifications to all these platforms at the same time.Pushwoosh is well-documented and very easy to integrate.It is nice to have a reliable cross-platform plugin for Unity3D.We love that we can use the Pushwoosh API via our own server to customize push notifications as needed.</p>
