<p>When I browse the web, there’s nothing less helpful than a progress bar that doesn’t give me any feedback on what’s actually happening.This usually happens when the application is working on a task that needs some time to process, like a data/file import or provisioning an account.This usually leaves me, the poor user, wondering if something went wrong with the app.Should I wait 5 more minutes before I refresh the page?Did I do something wrong?</p>
