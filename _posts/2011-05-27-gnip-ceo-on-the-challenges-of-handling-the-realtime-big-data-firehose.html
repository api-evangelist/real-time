<p>Last fall, Twitter announced a partnership with Gnip, making the latter company the only commercial provider of the Twitter activity stream.And although the firehose metaphor has been beaten to death, says Gnip CEO Jud Valeski, it still holds true.Valeski spoke today at Gluecon about the challenges of handling the firehose - what it means to process high volume, real-time data streams and to be able to do so in a consistent and predictable manner.Recent statistics demonstrate just how high a volume this Twitter data really is.Twitter is seeing around 155,000,000 tweets per day.</p>
