<p>Pushpin makes it easy to create HTTP long-polling and streaming services using any web stack as the backend.Itâ€™s compatible with any framework, whether Django, Rails, ASP, or even PHP.Pushpin works as a reverse proxy, sitting in front of your server application and managing all of the open client connections.Communication between Pushpin and the backend server is done using conventional short-lived HTTP requests and responses.There is also a ZeroMQ interface for advanced users.</p>
