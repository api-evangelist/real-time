<p>Now that PubSubHubbub evolved toward 0.4, and that what used to be the most popular reader are gone, it’s time to check the state of PubSubHubbub and see which of the new readers support it.We’ve picked the most popular web based readers from this list and we tested PubSubHubbub support on a feed that supports it, thru the Superfeedr PubSubHubbub Community hub (open to everyone!).If your reader is missing from that list, please let us know in the comments, subscribe to that feed and let us know in the comments when that’s done.</p>
