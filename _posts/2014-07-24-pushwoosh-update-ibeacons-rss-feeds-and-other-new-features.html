<p>My name is Gabriel Hernan Vion, I am a young game developer from Argentina.I work in a small digital agency called Quadramma as Interactive Designer.I was using Unity3d to make an application for a client which needed to have Push Notifications in order to send useful information to their users.As it was my first time working with iOS systems I didnt know where to start.So I googled the problem and tried several different approaches to it, but non of them seemed to work correctly.</p>
