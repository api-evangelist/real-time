<p>Mozilla’s TowTruck is a new project aimed at making it easy to collaborate on the web in real time — think real-time screensharing and co-authoring on any webpage.TowTruck is an experimental Labs project at the moment (alpha), but adding it to your site for testing takes only two lines of code.Head on over to the new TowTruck site to grab the code.If you’d like to try TowTruck from a user perspective, check out Mozilla’s demo pages.Originally conceived as a tool to help budding web developers by offering real-time collaboration — in other words a live, co-authoring environment you can use to demonstrate HTML and CSS — Mozilla says TowTruck is also useful for “mentoring, making travel plans, triaging bugs, navigating large sites or complicated interfaces.</p>
