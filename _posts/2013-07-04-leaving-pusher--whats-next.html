<p>Around 3 months ago I made the very difficult decision to leave Pusher.After just over 2 years I’m leaving behind what – up until now – has been the best job I’ve ever had.In this post I’ll cover what’s been achieved while I’ve been at Pusher, why I left and what I’m going to be doing next.Achievements
  Over the past 2 years Pusher has achieved a lot and I believe I’ve made a good contribution towards that.But, here I’m focusing on what I’ve done in my role as Developer Evangelist for Pusher.</p>
