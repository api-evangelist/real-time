<p>When Google announced it was shutting down Reader on July 1st, we took a couple days to announce that we will be offering a replacement for its API as well as back up as much of the data that we can.Finding the right tool to store all this data was tricky and as we have finally deployed that backend store we wanted.We have also started backing up significant amounts of data.We tried several times to find the perfect datastore to store the content that goes thru Superfeedr, but the fact is the size of that store quickly adds up.The average size of an entry that we store is about 2KB.</p>
