<p>Earlier this week, a bookmarklet was released that enlivens Hacker News comment threads.This thing makes me feel like I have magic powers.You have no idea how often I would refresh pages on HN before I started using this, especially on posts that are my own or that I had commented on.Now I can simply leave pages open in tabs and go about my day.The page titles update whenever there are new comments.</p>
