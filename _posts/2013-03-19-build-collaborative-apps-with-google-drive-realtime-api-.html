<p>Google Drive lets users create Docs, Sheets, and Slides, collaborate on them in real time, and have their changes saved automatically.With the new Google Drive Realtime API, you can now easily add some of the same real-time collaboration that powers Google Drive to your own apps.This new API handles network communication, storage, presence, conflict resolution, and other collaborative details so you can focus on building great apps.Developing for the Drive Realtime API is almost as simple as working with local objects.The API provides collaborative versions of familiar data objects such as maps, lists, strings, and JSON values and automatically synchronizes and stores modifications to these objects.</p>
