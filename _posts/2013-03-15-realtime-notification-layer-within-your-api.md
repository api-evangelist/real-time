<p>This story comes from Phil Leggetter (@leggetter) over at Pusher.Its about a client of theirs, cisimple, which provides continuous delivery services for mobile developers.cisimple just released a new API, which gives mobile developers more control over the build processes for their mobile applications.Using the cisimple API you can kick off new builds and download artifacts from your mobile dev process.cisimple is a very interesting API resource, that I will definitely be watching, and I&rsquo;m sure I will be writing about in the near future.</p>
