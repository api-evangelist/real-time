<p>For the past few years WebSockets has been gaining in popularity and availability.At the end of last year it moved one step closer to a standard by becoming a W3C Candidate Recommendation.Oracle and others have also recently submitted a request to start a standardisation effort around WebSockets (JSR 356) in the next version of Java Enterprise Edition.All of the major browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE, support one of the WebSockets revisions and will ultimately adopt whatever the standard eventually becomes.In a relatively short period of time, WebSockets has almost become an integral part of the Web.</p>
