<p>Webhooks provide a very elegant solution to the polling problem, and many popular APIs such as Github, Mailchimp, Instagram or even Shopify provide such hooks.However, we will see that they also have a bunch of limitations which are elegantly solved by PubSubHubbub and we want to encourage people with Webhook systems to consider these problems and maybe implement PubSubHubbub on top of them.Note: Even though PubSubHubbub was initially designed for RSS and Atom, its latest iteration is now completely agnostic as to what data is exchanged, making it very suitable for JSON resouces  
Automation  
Most webhooks patterns will require the developer to manually enter the callback on a specific interface.In practice it means that it’s quite hard to automate (using a script) the addition or removal of a webhook.Even though some services may have an API to add a callback, it’s  specific to each of them.</p>
