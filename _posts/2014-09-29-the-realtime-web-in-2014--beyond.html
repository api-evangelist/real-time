<p>Itâ€™s interesting how I used to always talk about the Real-time Web and Real-time Web Apps but now it really does need to be Real-time Internet Apps because we need to think beyond traditional Internet technologies.I also talk through the technology stack we have to build upon when trying to be innovative and that the new technologies we have now give us the opportunity to innovate sooner than ever before.You can view a recorded version of the talk below which I made as I was supposed to give the talk at another event but my car broke down and this was the only way I could still fulfil my commitment.My name is Phil Leggetter.Im a Developer Evangelist at Caplin Systems where Im a member of the BladeRunnerJS open source project team.</p>
