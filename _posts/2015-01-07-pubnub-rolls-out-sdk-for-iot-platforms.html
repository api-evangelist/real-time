<p>PubNub, provider of a cloud service for streaming data in real time, announced this week at the Consumers Electronics Show (CES) that it has created an SDK for embedded systems built with processors from Atmel.PubNub Chief Executive Officer Todd Greene says the SDK makes it possible to more easily build Internet of Things (IoT) applications by allowing devices based on Atmel processors to access the PubNub data stream network using the APIs that PubNub has created.While PubNub has created SDKs for a variety of processors used in embedded systems, Greene says the Atmel support is significant because Atmel has created a system-on-a-chip (SOC) platform for IoT devices that includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth network connectivity.Because it has reduced the cost of embedding networking capabilities inside IoT devices, Greene says Atmel processors are likely to show up in millions of IoT devices.Greene also says PubNub is benefitting from a surge of what he calls “second generation” IoT applications.</p>
