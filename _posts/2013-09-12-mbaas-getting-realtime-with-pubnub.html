<p>At the heart of backend as a service is data persistence.An easy way for developers to store  data in the cloud and retrieve it from any connected device on any platform through a RESTful API.Combined with user management, social integration and custom server-side code, you’ve got a powerful platform at your finger tips.One use case that traditionally is not supported by backend as a service is real-time data.For apps that want to implement chat, live auction, or graphs with realtime updates, developers often rely on “polling”.</p>
