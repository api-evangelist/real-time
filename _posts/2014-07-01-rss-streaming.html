<p>In the last year, we focused a lot on storing data from the feeds inside Superfeedr.We started by storing a lot of Google Reader content, using our Riak backend.When introducing our new PubSubHubbub endpoint, we had the opportunity to add things like subscribe and retrieve and later, params like before and after.We also introduced a Jquery plugin for Superfeedr which made it extremely easy to add any RSS feed to any web page.Today, weâ€™re moving forward by adding HTTP streaming support to the RSS stored in Superfeedr.</p>
