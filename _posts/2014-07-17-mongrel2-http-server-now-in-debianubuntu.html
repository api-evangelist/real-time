<p>Mongrel2 is a fast and simple HTTP & WebSocket server that communicates to backend workers via ZeroMQ.It does one thing and does it very well, making it an ideal part of a componentized architecture.The code is event-driven, allowing it to support thousands of concurrent connections and also asynchronous behaviors.These properties are especially important to realtime applications.Fanout has been one of the most active contributors to the Mongrel2 project over the past year, adding features such as TLS SNI and improved streaming capability.</p>
