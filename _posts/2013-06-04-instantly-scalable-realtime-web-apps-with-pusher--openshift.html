<p>In times gone by web applications had two key components; a client and a server.Dig deeper and you could break these components down further; a web server for serving both static and dynamic content, a persistence layer such as a database or key-value store, static client content such as HTML, CSS, and images, and JavaScript for richer functionality and client-side logic.As applications have become even richer – through the introduction of realtime interactive functionality – a layer of realtime web infrastructure has been added for instant communication between server and client.As you know, Pusher provides a scalable realtime web infrastructure which means you can add the kind of functionlaity to your apps that the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter have spent millions of dollars to build the infrastructure for.OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) providing support for PHP, Java, Ruby, Node.</p>
